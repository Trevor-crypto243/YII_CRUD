  $posts  = Posts::find()->all();
    echo '<pre>';
        print_r($posts); //prints to the console
    echo '</pre>';

//passing the data from the database to the html template
    $posts  = Posts::find()->all();
    return $this->render('Home',['posts'=>$posts]);

//mapping the data in the home page
<?php if(count($posts)>0): ?>
            <?php foreach($posts as $post): ?>
                <tr class="table-active">
                <th scope="row"><?php echo $post->id?></th>
                <td><?php echo $post->title?></td>
                <td><?php echo $post->description?></td>
                <td><?php echo $post->category?></td>

URL structure
http://hostname/index.php?r=ControllerID/ActionID&param1=value1&param2=value2...
web/index.php?r=site%2Flogin
index.php - filename
site - controller
login - view

Entry Script: index.php - In Yii applications, the index.php is the entry script that serves as the
starting point of the application.
Route: r=site%2Flogin - In Yii, the "route" parameter (r) is used to determine which controller action
to invoke. In this case, the route is encoded as "site%2Flogin". The "%2F" represents the URL-encoded 
forward slash (/). After decoding, the route becomes "site/login", which means the application is trying to access the "login" action in the "site" controller.
When this URL is accessed, Yii's URL Manager component will interpret the "route" parameter and invoke 
the appropriate controller action, in this case, the "login" action within the "site" controller.
The action can then handle the request and respond accordingly, such as displaying a login form or
processing the login credentials.
